# Foodie-fi-
In this Project we are analyzing the case study of Foodie-fi cooking video subscriptions.
Danny realized that he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had foodrelated content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows! Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new start-up Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!
This case study focuses on using subscription-style digital data to answer important business questions on Customer Journeys, Payments, and Business Performances.
